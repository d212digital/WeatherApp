# WeatherApp

Simple weather MVVM desktop application that uses the AccuWeather API to search cities and return to the user the current conditions. Clone the app, create your accuweather account and accuweather api app https://developer.accuweather.com/ then play around with it using your own API Key. Add your API Key in the ViewModel/Helpers/AccuWeatherHelper.cs class. 

This app uses the AutoCompleteAPI within the LocationsAPI https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-locations-api/apis/get/locations/v1/cities/autocomplete
and Current Conditions in https://developer.accuweather.com/accuweather-current-conditions-api/apis/get/currentconditions/v1/%7BlocationKey%7D
